### UFOs

## Overview of the Project
This analysis aims to help Dana create a webpage and dynamic table where she can display a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. 

This work allows users to filter the information for multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results
The biggest and most important result of this work is that it allows users to define and refine their search for UFO sightings to make it as precise as possible.

The user can begin the exploration of the information by filtering on Date, City, State, Country and Shape. These are considered, by the website, to be the main characteristics of UFO findings therefore these categories allow the user to explore and mix these in order to uncover patterns, trends and even new findings not identified before.

## Summary 
The webpage and dynamic table hav the main drawback that to be updated a constant manipulation of the html and js files is needed. For further development, the two recommendations given are: (1) to always keep the code clean to avoid confusion and mistakes and (2) keep the data.js file constantly updated to ensure webpage and dynamic table display accurate information.
